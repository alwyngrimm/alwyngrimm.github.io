  <h1>Lore of the Awaken One</h1>
  <p>I found him sleeping in the dungeon. </p>
    A place i had no intention of going into if i was not running from those pesky demons in the first place neither did i intend to wake him up. Because that would be rude.</p>
Here lies the dreamer, in an endless slumber. </br>
The sleep granted to him by a mage to save the world from his wrath.</br>
Or so they say in the stories </br>
I dare not wake him up, not because i was afraid but because waking up a sleeping person is straight up disrespectful</br>
Plus stories are just that stories</p>
A person cant be alive for 1000s of years even if they are in a coma. but regardless of my intents, a snake had some other ideas.</p>
Our little scaly friend made me jump across the room and a relic was a casualty in my little misadventure.</br>
But despites its small stature, it must have been holding up this place because suddenly there was a loud explosion.</br>
It felt as if the ground was going to rip itself apart.</p>
And in the smoke I saw a silhouette.</br>
I was in shock. </br>
I have done what no mortal should have done.</br>
I have awakened the dreamer………..</p>
