  <h1>Lore of the Awaken One</h1>
  <p>I found him sleeping in the dungeon. 
    A place i had no intention of going into if i was not running from those pesky demons in the first place neither did i intend to wake him up. Because that would be rude.</p>
Here lies the dreamer, the person who lies in an endless slumber.
The sleep granted to him by a mage to save the world from his wrath
Or so they say in the stories
I dare not wake him up not because i was afraid but because waking up a sleeping person is straight up disrespectful
Plus stories are just that stories
A person cant be alive for 1000s of years even if they are in a coma. So whatever was sleeping here I didn't intend to wake them up but a snake had some other ideas.
Our little scaly friend made me jump across the room and a relic was a casualty in my little misadventure. But this small relic must have been holding up this place because suddenly there was a loud explosion. It felt as if the ground was going to rip itself apart. And in the smoke I saw a silhouette.
I was in shock. Cs I have done what no mortal should have done.
I have awakened the dreamer………..</p>
